## 📋 Recent Changes (June 2026)

- **Enrollment status on course detail**: Enrolled users now see "Continue Learning" + "Enrolled ✓" badge instead of "Enroll Now — ৳XXX"
- **Payment verification by payment_id**: PaymentResultPage now verifies using `payment_id` from URL, fixing the `{pp_id}` placeholder issue
- **PipraPay natural redirect**: Full-page redirect instead of iframe for better payment gateway compatibility
- **Round figure amounts**: All prices and discounted amounts display as whole numbers (Math.round)
- **Discounted price calculation**: `getDiscountedPrice()` returns rounded values in both SubscriptionPage and CourseDetailPage
- **Fixed profile edit**: Institute & semester now save correctly (D1 SQLITE_MISMATCH fix — string→INTEGER conversion in worker API)
- **Semester badge**: Profile page now shows semester badge (e.g. "Sem 3") alongside institute and technology — uses Math.floor to avoid "3.0"
- **Profile stats API**: `/api/student/profile/stats` now returns `profile` object for pre-filling edit form
- **OneSignal ServiceWorker fix**: Wrapped importScripts in try-catch to prevent console errors on Cloudflare Pages static export
- **Search results images**: Instructor avatars and course thumbnails now display in search results instead of placeholder icons
- **Semester persistence**: Semester now survives page refresh — stored via /auth/me and profile/stats API
- **Institute name from API**: Login and refreshUser now get institute name directly from /auth/me response
- **Progressive image loading**: All images across the app now use lazy loading + progressive blur-up (ProgressiveImage component) — IntersectionObserver-based lazy load with shimmer placeholder, smooth crossfade transition, and error fallback
- **Radix Avatar lazy**: AvatarImage components now include `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"` for deferred loading
- **Instructor avatars fixed**: InstructorsPage now shows actual profile pictures via ProgressiveImage (was showing only initial letter)
- **Removed mock data**: Downloads, Certificates, and all Exam pages (Prep, Schedule, Results, Practice) no longer use hardcoded mock data
- **Certificates API-connected**: CertificatesPage fetches from real /api/student/certificates endpoint
- **Dynamic departments**: Sidebar Departments section now fetches active technologies from Admin Panel API instead of hardcoded list
- **Admin-editable exam tips**: ExamTipsPage now fetches tips from /api/exam-tips endpoint (stored in app_config, editable by admin via D1)
